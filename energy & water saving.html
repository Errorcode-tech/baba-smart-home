        <h2>What is Energy & Water management in smart homes ?</h2>

        <h3>Definition :</h3>
        <p>A suite of intelligent devices designed to monitor, control, and optimize energy consumption throughout the home.</p>

        <h3>Benefit :</h3>
        <p>Leads to reduced energy bills, lower carbon footprint, and increased energy efficiency, contributing to both 
            cost savings and environmental sustainability.</p>

        <h3>Description & Application :</h3>
        <h4>Smart Meter :</h4>
        <img src="images/energy saving.png" alt="" align="right" border="5">
        <p>- A smart meter compliant with local authority requirements to monitor energy 
            consumption in real-time, providing detailed insights into usage patterns and 
            identifying opportunities for energy savings.</p>

        <p>- Schedule and automate the useage of all systems to ensure optimal useage.</p>
        
        <p>- Track electricity, gas, or water usage in real-time using smart meters or energy monitors.</p>
        
        <p>- Predict monthly energy bills based on usage patterns.</p>
        
        <p>- Use energy data to identify trends, optimize energy usage, and set energy-saving goals.</p>
        
        <p>- Receive alerts for unusual energy and water consumption patterns that may indicate appliance malfunctions or leaks.</p>
        
        <p>- Receive alerts for periodic checks and maintenance of critical systems</p>
        
        <p>- Personalized recommendations on how to reduce energy and water consumption and 
            lower your bills.</p>

        <p>- Integration of solar into the energy management 
            system to optimize energy production and usage.</p>

        <p>- Integration of EV charging usage into overall 
            sustainablity contribution and cost management.</p>

        <p>- Smart irrigation controllers use weather data, soil moisture sensors, and 
            plant types to optimize watering schedules, reducing water waste and ensuring 
            healthy plants.</p>

        <p>- Smart sensors monitor water chemistry, temperature, and pump operation for 
            efficient maintenance and energy savings.</p>

        <p>- Sensored faucets reduce water waste by automatically turning off when not in use.</p>

        <p>- Smart systems can collect and treat wastewater from showers, sinks, and laundry 
            for reuse in irrigation or toilet flushing.</p>

        <p>- Integration with renwable energy & their smart meters (PV meters).</p>

        <p>- Photocell with timers to controll external lighting on/off along with 
            presence sensor if required.</p>

        <h4>Smart Outlets :</h4>

        <img src="images/water management.webp" alt="" align="right" border="5">

        <p>- Energy monitoring smart for individual appliances and 
            smart outlets with capabilities to optimize energy usage via a central platform.</p>

        <p>- There are a few ways to turn ordinary home lighting into smart lighting. One 
            way is through the sockets. Amazon offers a line of smart plugs that allow you 
            to control your home lighting through a smartphone app. You can schedule when 
            your lights are on or off, set light levels, and check your home lighting status 
            while you are away. You can also set up schedules through the Alexa app so 
            the lights can turn on and off at specific times.</p>

        <h4>Smart Thermostats :</h4>
        <p>- Zoned heating and cooling system with smart thermostats that learn occupant 
            preferences and adjust temperatures, accordingly, incorporating geofencing and 
            occupancy sensors for further optimization.</p>

        <h4>Smart Appliances :</h4>
        <p>- Household appliances equipped with  connectivity and smart technology, 
            allowing for remote control, energy monitoring, and automation of various tasks.</p>
        
        <p>- Streamlines daily routines, saves time, and enhances convenience by allowing 
            residents to control and monitor appliances remotely, receive maintenance alerts, 
            and optimize energy usage.</p>

        <p>- Kitchens serve as a hub for families and friends to come together. Smart 
            kitchen technologies can help with staying connected and taking away the 
            stresses of cooking.</p>

        <p>Wifi-connected coffee makers - Start brewing your coffee from anywhere 
            using a smartphone app. </p>

        <p>Smart Cooktops - Induction cooktops with touch controls, safety features like automatic shut-off, 
            and connectivity to voice assistants for hands-free operation.</p>

        <p>Smart Microwaves - Equipped with sensors to prevent overcooking, voice control 
            compatibility, and scan-to-cook technology where they can read barcodes on 
            packaged foods and cook them accordingly.</p>

            <img src="images/WhatsApp Image 2024-12-30 at 12.14.37 PM (3).jpeg" alt="" align="right" border="5">

        <p>Smart Range Hoods – These can automatically turn on when they detect heat or smoke and 
            can be controlled via smartphone apps or voice commands.</p>

        <p>Smart Slow Cookers and Pressure Cookers – Devices like the WiFi-enabled Instant Pot allow 
            you to control cooking times and modes remotely.</p>

        <p>Smart Blenders – These can weigh ingredients, follow recipes from an app, and adjust blending 
            speed and time accordingly.</p>

        <p>Automated Bread Makers – You can control them via an app, set timers, and choose from 
            various recipes for a fresh loaf every time.</p>

        <p>Robotic Vacuum Cleaners: While not entirely touchless in operation, once set up, robotic 
            vacuums can clean entire homes with minimal human interaction.</p>

        <p>Robotic vacuums are not new—iRobot first offered the Roomba in 2002 and has sold 
            millions of units since. Newer models have impressive features including 
            learning functions that enable them to memorize obstacles and drop-offs 
            in frequently cleaned spaces so it can clean more quickly and efficiently. 
            What makes these new vacuums truly smart, however, is the ability to start, 
            schedule, and even steer the vacuums from your smartphone using apps.</p>
